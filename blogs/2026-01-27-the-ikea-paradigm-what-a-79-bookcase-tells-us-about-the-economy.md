**The BILLY Bookcase Index. The Historic Indicator For Life.**

You have everything you could’ve ever wanted, and yet, there’s still something missing. Something you can’t yet formulate into coherent words or thought. Something that I finally learned today — something I couldn’t envision because I lacked the experience to see what was missing.

It’s like going to a bookstore to shop for cars. You might find some books about that Subaru you’ve been eyeing, but you sure won’t be test driving it to see if you like it. Yeah, that kind of feeling.

All my life I’ve been taught that life is about doing what you love, and I was one of the lucky ones. Or maybe I’m just a little strange for enjoying staring at millions of lines of logs all day, trying to decipher what our teams could use to create baselines for detection signatures. To me, it’s like walking into a McDonald’s PlayPlace with a ball pit filled with Legos and building a massive fort with a moat and everything.

See, the thing I didn’t realize until just now as I’m typing this is that we all eventually outgrow the Legos, yet we still can never get enough if that’s what we know we love to do. The beautiful thing about Legos is that you can do it like IKEA.

***Who needs to RTFM anyway.***

Think about it — there’s a reason why the manual is not included in the plastic with all the tools and screws that lay beside you as you’re physically building it. If the genius teams of engineers, designers, and psychologists at Ikea can distill a complex set of instructions down into simple unified visuals then they’ve definitely thought about placement from every angle.

In the world of Legos, not all come with instructions by design. Instructions provide guidance and once you have the experience of building the same castle different ways two or three times, you’ll start experimenting — new ways to fortify a castle, maybe with a portcullis and a drawbridge. And then some strategically placed arrow slits, aka loopholes.

The thing we tend to forget after years of stubbing our bare toes on Lego bricks is this: there are only a few limited ways to *build* a castle, but nearly infinite ways to *design* one.

I’m sure many of you reading this have experienced this before. Your loved ones ask you to put together a shelf, and you start unboxing everything and leaving the instructions in the box. Even when you feel stuck at a certain point, unsure if you have the right piece, you’re saying to yourself “Nope! I’ve got this.” Instead of reaching for the manual.

Well, what if I told you that maybe this process was all by design? Genius intent by some very mad Swedish engineers and psychologists who figured this out.

If they really wanted you to read the manual, they would’ve placed it in the plastic bags with the screws so it’s by your side — not buried in the box. They know you don’t need it. They’ve perfected the universal language of art, not just in the manuals but in the form and structure that makes a shelf, a shelf.

They have entire teams of engineers, psychologists, and philosophers whose sole job is to reinvent the meaning of “shelf” and iterate on it until it’s perfected.

The truth is, what I just said was all pure speculation, because I really don’t know. What I *do* know is this: they weren’t reinventing the definition or changing the design in drastic ways — it largely remained the same. The driving factor for change was the need to adapt to the ever-changing global supply chain as certain materials become less accessible over time, simply due to inefficiencies and cost.

Just by looking at *when* IKEA launched a new version of their bookshelf, you can tell exactly how the market is doing. And guess what — it’s not looking so hot.

Why reinvent the wheel? Because there’s always a more feasible fiscal way to do it. That’s why.

Plastic-free edging or not, the truth for any company is in the numbers: reduce cost and adjust to the market. They did the math. They know that the total sunk cost and operational expenses of changing the entire supply chain — just to replace the plastic edge with paper — will reduce operating and manufacturing costs in the long run.

  | Year | IKEA BILLY Iteration | Economic Context |  
  |------|----------------------|------------------|  
  | 1979 | Original Launch (90cm wide) | Oil Crisis / High Inflation |  
  | 1981 | White Lacquer Added | Volcker Interest Rate Hikes / Early 80s Recession |  
  | 1988 | Width Change (80cm) | Post-1987 Market Crash / Late 80s Growth |  
  | 1992 | Formaldehyde Fix (E1 emission standard) | Early 90s Post-Gulf War Recovery |  
  | 1999 | Shift to Melamine Foil (Replaced lacquer) | Dot-com Bubble / High Growth |  
  | 2008 | Deep Shelves Introduced (For non-books) | Global Financial Crisis |  
  | 2014 | Structural Reinforcement | Post-Crisis Recovery / Eurozone Debt Crisis |  
  | 2022 | Transition to Paper Foil (Replaced veneer) | Post-Pandemic Inflation Spike |  
  | 2024 | Global Relaunch & Snap-fits | High Cost-of-Living / Post-Inflation Peak |  
  | 2026 | Plastic-Free Edging Complete | Current Sustainable Market Pivot / AI Boom |
```

I know there are a lot more intricate systems at play — from macro to micro — that go beyond the structural and material changes I simply don’t have access to. But what I do know, more empirically, is this: when a company can sustain itself for so many years and still remain private without requiring funding from the general public, they’re clearly doing something right.

That’s why I believe the IKEA Paradigm is such a fascinating way of viewing a large, complex system from a single layer. The numbers speak for themselves, and the same patterns can be observed in almost every system if you know where to look.

Did I know that IKEA would become a case study for this blog when I started writing about Legos? Not at all. But what I do know is that the BILLY bookcase only accounts for approximately 1% of their total sales. And after just three quick searches, I’m now more reasonably convinced that we’re either facing a market “pivot” — as the world’s resources are being pooled into new industries and infrastructure that AI has enabled us to build — meaning there’s less purchasing power for other shared goods.

### But How Can We Evaluate If This Is True?

Well, for one, I wish I’d paid more attention in econ class, because I’m only now learning about a confusing-sounding thing called the “Consumer Discretionary Sector Alpha” — or the Consumer Discretionary Index (XLY). Unlike the S&P 500, this is an industry-specific ETF that measures products you can actually buy and sell in exchange for goods and services.

It lets us remove the “noise” — what I like to call a Coherence Score. Essentially, it allows us to filter out unrelated sectors like energy or tech so we can find the needle in the haystack and determine whether it’s a steel needle or a plastic one.

### A Recession or a technological Renaissance?

Well, it’s clear that by looking at the math and the historical trends of the BILLY Bookshelf Paradigm that I’m not an economist. I’ll let you draw your own conclusions while I draw mine by prying more into how complex systems work around us.

The best part about prying into things? Eventually, you’ll always end up finding something cool that makes you look at bookshelves and legos from a different vantage point. It may not always come immediately — however, questioning everything, even when you think you already know the answer, is truly a superpower when paired with the right building blocks which we all have.

Or, as I like to say: Insight is action through lived experience, and experience is the absence of insight. *Measureable, and actionable.*

That quote is what led me here today. Writing this. Because now I can finally begin to see vectors in this game of universal chess.

After a little more digging, I found that even Bloomberg considered the IKEA Paradigm such an interesting case study that they coined the phrase “Billy Bookcase Index” to compare purchasing power and relative price levels across countries.

A deviation in the “IKEA Paradigm” might not just be about the furniture market — it could also reflect a shift in how investors are valuing e-commerce or electric vehicles relative to traditional retail giants like IKEA.

### So, What Did We Learn From All of This?

The next time you see a sale on a BILLY bookcase — reserve your capital and invest wisely. It’s probably at a low. *(Disclaimer: I am not an economist and this is not empirical advice. Read between the lines.)*

Why? Because private companies act as more reliable signal indicators since shareholders aren’t a variable in their equation.

Whether we’re in a recession or not, I’ll leave up to you and the economists to decide.

### The Question

Your metaphorical castle: do you draw it out first, then lay it brick by brick, layer by layer? Or do you begin by measuring the Lego figurine to determine the right position — to create the Goldilocks door that’s just right?

Your mind loves to trick you into doing what feels safe — guaranteeing a plausible outcome. It’s biologically wired into us. We like to build walls. We like comfort and familiarity.

**But what if those walls were broken down? What do you do?**

There’s a reason why not all Legos come with their own set of instructions. Building blocks are tools we create that allow us to interact with the environment around us. What we *do* with these tools — that’s what makes us all uniquely special.

The options are limitless. There’s no right or wrong answer, so long as it suits your need. That’s the beauty of knowing, and the wonder of seeing.

**Me?** *I would combine the water from the moat with the clay in the soil, mix it with limestone to get cement, and pave the concrete layers. Because anything stronger just gets too hard to work with — literally.*

What would you do?
